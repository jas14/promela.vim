This is a syntax highlighting plugin for the Promela language used with SPIN
that is compatible with plugin managers like Pathogen.

Credits to [Pieter Loubser](http://www.vim.org/account/profile.php?user_id=3606) and to [Maurizio Tranchero](mailto:maurizio.tranchero@polito.it) for their versions of the plugin; the code here is mostly a combination of their work.
